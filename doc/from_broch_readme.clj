;; ## Ten meters

^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(clerk/caption
 "with Broch"
 (clerk/code '(b/meters 10)))

;; To make this work, I need:
;; - multiplication - 10 * meters
;; - coercion - coerce 10 and BaseUnit to Quantity
;; - simplification - to present the result.

;; Requirements:
;; - coerce BaseUnit to Quanity
;; - coerce number to Quanitty
;; - Simplify Quantity to vector of multiplication parts
